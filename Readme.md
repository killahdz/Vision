## üöÄ Overview

Vision Server is a high-performance, production-grade platform for **real-time multi-camera image acquisition** in demanding industrial environments.  
It is designed for use cases such as **AI-powered grading, defect detection, and automation** on high-speed production lines.

Built in modern C# with .NET 8, it integrates industry-standard technologies such as **GigE Vision** and **GeniCam** for robust, scalable hardware integration and high-throughput image streaming.

> ‚öôÔ∏è This project demonstrates advanced architectural patterns, real-time streaming, and deep integration with industrial vision standards.
