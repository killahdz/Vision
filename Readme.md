## üöÄ Overview

This repository contains a production-grade **vision acquisition server**, purpose-built for high-speed industrial environments such as **AI-powered grading and defect detection** in sawmills and manufacturing.

The system listens for encoder-triggered image requests via gRPC and orchestrates image capture, telemetry, logging, and robust error handling across multiple industrial cameras.

> ‚öôÔ∏è Built from scratch in C#, this codebase is a showcase of Daniel Kereama‚Äôs architectural and implementation expertise in real-time, fault-tolerant .NET systems.

## üí° Key Features

- **gRPC encoder stream ingestion** for real-time frame requests
- **Multi-camera coordination** with per-device telemetry and retries
- **Channel-based frame queues** with async processing per camera
- **Dynamic acquisition modes** (`Run`, `Debug`, `Offline`)
- **Structured logging** via Serilog and console refresh support
- **Graceful shutdown** with error queues and retry logic
- **Health monitoring** for encoder stream, cameras, and queues
- **Flexible debug image saving**, file format toggles (RAW/PNG), and intelligent folder layout

## üîß Configuration Overview (`appsettings.json`)

All runtime behavior is controlled via `appsettings.json`:

### üîå ServerOptions
- `IP` / `PortNumber`: Bind address and port (default `0.0.0.0:19002`)
- `ImageAcquisitionMode`: Run, Debug, or Offline mode
- `Incoming/OutgoingConcurrentRequestLimit`: Request throttling
- `BufferSize`: Retention buffer (~5s at 460)
- `LoggingLevel`: Verbosity (`Trace` ‚Üí `Critical`)
- `ImageProcessingClientSkip`: Toggle gRPC downstream sending

### üì∏ Cameras
- Define up to **8 concurrent GigE cameras** in `CameraOptions.Cameras[]`
- Each camera has:
  - `Id`, `Name`, `CameraAddress`, and `ReceiverAddress/Port`
  - `Resolution` (`Width`, `Height`), `OffsetX/Y`
  - Unique `MacAddress`, `Serial`
  - Visual `Accent` for diagnostics and display

### üß† Subsystems
- `RetrySettings`: Millisecond delays between retries
- `FrameProcessingChannel`: Frame queue capacity & overflow mode (`DropOldest`)
- `DebugImageSettings`: Save PNG/RAW images into `DebugImages/{Date}/{CameraId}/`
- `FileWriteQueue`: Control concurrency and format (`SaveRaw`, `SavePng`)
- `StreamMonitor`: Periodic encoder health polling (default: 7s)
- `CameraHealth`: Per-camera status checks (default: 1s, with console refresh)
- `EncoderStreamSettings`: Defines encoder stream IP/port and retry backoff

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- [.NET 8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)
- **gRPC** for streaming control
- **Serilog** for structured file-based logging
- **System.Threading.Channels**, `SemaphoreSlim`, `ConcurrentDictionary`
- **Protobuf** contract definitions (`IA.Vision.Rpc`)
- Native SDKs for industrial camera capture (GeniCam/GigE Vision)

## üîç How It Works

1. **Startup**: Cameras connect via GigE with validation and retry logic.
2. **Streaming**: Encoder sends ticks (via gRPC) triggers captures on movement.
3. **Acquisition**: Server captures frames, queues for processing or saving.
4. **Telemetry**: All activity tracked and logged by `VisionMonitorService`.
5. **Shutdown**: Channels flushed, hardware connections disposed, errors saved.

## üì¶ Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/VisionServer.git`

2. Open `ImageAcquisition.sln` in Visual Studio or Rider

3. Configure:
   - Update `appsettings.json` with your camera IPs, encoder address, and operational preferences

4. Build & Run:
   - Start `IA.Vision.App`
   - Connect encoder stream and camera hardware
